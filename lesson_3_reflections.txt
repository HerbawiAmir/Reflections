When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
when your working outside your office!

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
since the change could be made by someone else and that he could still be testing 

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
fork is to clone the repositry to your github since you don't have a premission to eidt it, clones to copy it again all but this time to your desktp, a branch is a testing side mechansim to test new features.you could fork insted of clone.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
working separetly and editing, when feeling confideant about the code you can upload and merge

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
you would have to work with the traditional texting or have to work in person, i do belive that github is a truly great achivement

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?
When i want from the coders to check the work that i have added before implementing it to the master branch. while directly might soun tempting and easier, another branch and pull a request will grab an eye, this might provide another solution/method which might be handy!
